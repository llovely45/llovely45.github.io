Some museum fans may have paid multiple visits last year, but on average, every Chinese person visited a museum in the country once in 2024.

在去年，一些博物馆爱好者应该进行了多次的参观，但是平均来看，在2024年中，每个中国人都参观了博物馆一次。

As a document released by the National Cultural Heritage Administration on Friday showed, more than 1.4 billion visits — roughly equal to the nation's population — were made to museums across the country last year, setting a new yearly record.

根据国家文化遗产管理局在周五发布的文件显示，在全国超过14亿人口访问，大约等于国家人口总数，创下了一个新的年度记录。

The popularity of such facilities among the public reflects the fruitful achievements of cultural heritage-related promotional and educational efforts in China.

在众多公共设施中受欢迎，反映了中国文化遗产相关的推广和教育取得丰富的成就。

Also, according to the administration, since the 4th national census of cultural relics launched in November 2023, over 93 percent of some 710,000 previously registered "immovable cultural relics" — defined in China as archaeological sites, historical monuments, ancient architecture, rock carvings and so on — had been rechecked nationwide to ensure such ongoing classification by last week. Another 52,000 such relics were newly discovered in the ongoing census, which is expected to last until next year.

而且，根据管理局在2023年11月推出的第四次国家文化遗产普查中显示，超过93%的71万件以前登记为“不可移动文化遗产”（在中国定义为文化遗址，历史古迹，古建筑，石刻等）在全国范围内被重新检查，确保在上周之前进行分类。另外52000件文物在普查中被新发现，预计普查持续到明年。

Archaeological work continued to be conducted in an orderly way, demonstrating key progress. In 2024, 259 proactive excavations were initiated to solve crucial academic issues. They focused not only on long-explored landmark sites marking early-stage civilization — such as the Yinxu and Erlitou sites in Henan province — but also new areas like deep-sea research on two Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) shipwrecks in the South China Sea.

考古工作继续有序进行，并展示关键工作。在2024，开启了259次主动挖掘以解决关键学术问题。他们集中不仅长期探索早期文明标志性遗址（例如殷墟和河南省二里头遗址）而且探索新的地区像两艘明代的沉船一样的深海探索在中国南海。

"We'll continuously strengthen archaeology and thus better explain Chinese civilization," said Li Qun, director of the administration.

”我们将会继续加强考古，因此能更好的解释中国文化“党委书记利群说

In preparation for infrastructure construction, another 1,480 excavations were launched last year to better protect heritage sites. More than 10 new museums opened on major archaeological sites.

为了基础设施建设，另外1480个遗址发掘在去年启动，为了更好的保护他。超过十家博物馆在主要的遗址开放。

The newest findings on the origins of Chinese civilization were included in the latest versions of history textbooks for elementary and high school students.

Last year, a total of 36 Chinese cultural relic exhibitions were held abroad, and 211 lost Chinese relics overseas were repatriated on seven occasions from countries including the United States, Japan, Argentina and Italy. China is also drafting national-level guidance concerning cross-border joint archaeological research in the next decade.

"(In 2025,) China will promote friendly relations between World Heritage Sites in China and other countries," Li said. "More work will be done to advance the return of key cultural relics to the motherland."

An exhibition is planned for later this year to showcase the achievements of repatriated Chinese cultural relics since 2012, he added.
